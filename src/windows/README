Some notes on how to properly generate the .def files.

A quick-and-dirty way to generate them is via nm if you have a build on another
OS (see comments in Makefiles). However, this doesn't seem to quite work out
because i) different name mangling conventions on other OSes related to
underscores (and not just the leading underscore on OSX) and also ii) this will
list the symbols in a non-Windows build configuration which is not super
accurate.

Therefore, what I recommend is:

(in a VS prompt)

  dumpbin /symbols /out:exports libevercrypt_code.lib

then:

   grep External exports | cut -c 49- | egrep '^EverCrypt'

A little hackish but works out fine.
